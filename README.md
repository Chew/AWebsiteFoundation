## What is this?

I am taking web design and development classes in school, So, I decided to make my own website from scratch using skills I learned from those classes. If it looks bad, I haven't learned the skill needed to make it look good.

## It looks bad

Well geez i try my best

## Will you accept Pull Requests?

Probably not, unless it's a spelling error. I type fast not accurate sorry.

## Why don't you accept issues?

Because this is for experienced developers. If THEY find an issue with MY code, then THEY know how to fix it and they will go ahead and PR it. If you don't know what you're doing why bother.

## Cool site bro

thanks bro
